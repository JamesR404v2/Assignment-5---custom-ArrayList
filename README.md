# Assignment-5---custom-ArrayList

This is an exercise assignment where I created a custom ArrayList class that doubles in size whenever needed. 

Practically you would never do this as Java has built in functions like Map to automatically grow the array size. But this is an interesting practice assignment for implementing an Interface.
